# Appendix E: Bug Tracking

This document contains a list of the known bugs in _Oberon PSA Crypto_, as well
as a list of security vulnerabilities.

## Bug Table

Bugs that have been both introduced in pre-release versions of the software, and
fixed in the final versions of the corresponding releases, are not included in
the following table. Neither included are bugs in experimental features (e.g., a
PAKE implementation based on a beta API specification).

| Bug ID | Fixed in Release | Title                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                |

## Security Vulnerability Table

Some bugs may result in security vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities are
tracked in a separate table with CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):

| CVE ID         | Bug ID | Affected Versions | Severity | Description                                                                                             |
